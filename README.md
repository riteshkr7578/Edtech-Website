# Edtech-Website
[I designed and developed this EdTech website entirely from scratch, utilizing HTML and CSS for structure and styling. I incorporated JavaScript to enhance interactivity and functionality, such as
 dynamic navigation and improved user experience. Additionally, I used Bootstrap to streamline the development process, ensuring a responsive and mobile-friendly design. For the UI/UX design, I extensively
 researched online resources and references to create a user-friendly and intuitive interface that appeals to students, educators, and learners. The website features well-organized sections for educational
 content, seamless navigation, and consistent typography, color schemes, and spacing to deliver a professional and cohesive look.
